								<span style='font-size: 27px;'><b>The Hawk Origins</b></span><br><br>
								The Hawk has been soaring the skies for years under many different aliases. It's existence has been questioned by many.<br><br>
								For the first time ever, we are revealing the story of the Hawk as part of HawkEye.
								<br> <br>This is how it all began.
							</div>
							<div class='storyText'  id='ST1'>
							The story started on a normal summer day in Manipal. The sun shone brightly, there was an
							aroma of food at KC as usual and tired college students were making their way to different parts of the 
							city to cool off after a long day. A few friends are joking around when...
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST2'>
							An email from an unknown sender suddenly appears into one of their inboxes. The student’s curiosity gets the better of him as he discovers the key to the start of a cryptic puzzle that his perceptive and keen mind cannot say no to...	
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST3'>
							Through a toiling 24 hours and hardly getting a few hours of interrupted sleep in the night, our student, Arjun finally felt that he has deciphered the code and solved the puzzle. <br><br> "Phew, I’m finally done..." sighed Arjun when...</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST4'>
								<b>*Buzz buzz!*</b> the phone rang once again with yet another email and yet another puzzle! A tired Arjun had just been thinking about catching up on some well-deserved sleep but the itch to draw out the secret from the puzzle waxed within him once more. <br><br> "<b>*Sigh*</b> It's gonna be another long day..." Arjun thought, hiding the small bit of enthusiasm he had about the complex riddle he had just gotten.
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST5'>
								“This reminds me of how dad and I used to solve puzzles when I was a child…” Arjun thought. Those fond memories were so far away yet felt like they had just been yesterday as the puzzles gave Arjun a medium to reminisce.
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST6'>
								Hours became days and days became weeks, and soon everything was slipping out of Arjun’s hand...
								<br><br>His semester was drifting away, his straight A GPA a dream now and his sleep cycle more messed up than an Agatha Christie novel...
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST7'>
								As the time went the puzzles got harder and harder the game stepped to a level higher and higher... It wasn't just a set of puzzles anymore it was like Sherlock and Moriarty, L and light, the light side and the dark side. It had become an obsession... An obsession with keen observation...
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST8'>
								There seemed no end to the puzzles as one pointed to the next until they became part of Arjun’s lifestyle. The days of DT and cafe 18 were over and only his room 715 remained his abode. Friendships deteriorated, relationships severed, ties cut till the only thing left in his life was his computer. Until finally...
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST9'>
								 <b>"13°21'20"N 74°47'23"E"</b> showed up on the screen and a quick Google search revealed that they were the coordinates to a nearby sports complex warehouse that had been shut for a few years. <br><br>"What could they really mean?" thought Arjun and without time to think a second time, he was out of the door headed towards the warehouse...
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST10'>
								Reaching the warehouse, Arjun saw a big steel vault door with a camera fixed on the top like an all seeing eye. The last few weeks flashed in front of his eyes as both a sense of excitement and a tinge of fear surged through him. It was time to finally figure out who was behind this and end it…
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST11'>
								As he built up the nerve to figure out what lay on the other side of the door he saw the camera gazing towards him. Watching him intently with its mechanical eye as if it were reaching in and ripping apart his soul. Just as he wondered whether it might have been a good idea, the blast door opened *whoosh*
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST12'>
								Arjun: "You did all this? It was you? After all this time?”. <br><br>“Always..." Said the hooded figure as he moved into the bright sunshine to reveal himself to be Karan, Arjun’s long half-brother who had been separated after the tragedy that had befallen their family... <br><br>That was more than a few years ago now though...
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST13'>
								"Our dad had always taught us to solve the best puzzles didn’t he?” said Karan as his voice grew emotional. It had been a few years since their father had been missing and their family left in tatters. Karan: "You didn't know it at the time but Dad had left us a clue of where he went and I left in search of him. It was a cryptic hunt like dad liked to call it but unfortunately what I found was a body bag at the end of it". 
								<br><br>“They murdered him Arjun! Dad was killed!”
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST14'>
								"I went into seclusion for a while. I didn't want you to face the feeling of trauma and guilt I had at the time and I needed to find myself. I decided it enough was enough and I had to make sure that the people who did this paid in a similar vein. So I came to you to see if you had it in you and sure enough you’ve proved to me to that your potential is boundless...”
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST15'>
								"I've achieved so much myself as the Hawk and I can only imagine how much we can achieve together.” said Karan, his voice growing stronger and stronger with each syllable. “They did something to someone we loved and now the world must face judgement... It's time we took to our skills and eradicated the world of such sick people and granted our brand of justice to the pathetic filth and build a new world! Will you join me?” 
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST16'>
								“No… No!” said Arjun with a voice of determination that even took Karan a little time to digest. “We were so happy before all of this… I’ve been ignoring everyone and everything around me for too long and I can’t do this anymore. Its time this stopped. We can have a normal life… A life dad would have wanted us to have…“said Arjun as he walked out of the vault leaving nothing but cold walls to give Karan company.
							</div>
							<div class='storyText' id='ST17'>
								A few people know about what happened after the two brothers that separated that dreaded day. All we know is the hawk manifests itself twice a year and makes the world bow to its knees. Over time, everyone in Manipal have picked their side, made their own assumptions and formed their own theories.
								<br><br>I have my story… Do you?
